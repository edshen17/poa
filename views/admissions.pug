      h1 Admissions
      p Admission to Preschool of America is based on a rolling enrollment system. Families may enroll children at any time. Acceptance is based on space availability. A registration fee is required and can be applied to the wait list if space is not currently available. A deposit is required to enroll all children and guarantee placement at the school.
      p All necessary forms for each studentâ€™s file are required to be completed prior to the first day a child attends school. Children must have a current health department medical form at the time of enrollment. Please keep the school updated with ongoing immunization records. Special needs children are evaluated individually prior to enrollment. We are happy to welcome them if it is mutually determined that we can meet their needs.
